# Sport App Constructor

> A generic, open-source sports tracker scaffold for anyone tired of paying for simple sport tracker apps ‚Äì build your own, customize at will, and own all your data.

## üöÄ Overview

- **Multi-Sport Support**: Easily track activities such as running, cycling, swimming, and more.
- **Customizable Workouts**: Define your own exercise types, durations, intervals, and metrics.
- **Data Persistence**: Built-in database support for offline tracking and secure data storage.
- **Modular Architecture**: Swap or extend components (UI, storage, analytics) without rewriting the core logic.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-sourced under the MIT License.
